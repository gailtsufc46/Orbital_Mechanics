%% Problem 3.4
%
% In terms of the eccentricity e, the period T and the angles alpha and
% beta (in radians), find the time t required to fly from pt. 1 to pt. 2 on 
% the ellipse. C is the center of the ellipse.
%
% Given:
%   a, e, T, alpha, beta
%
% Find an expression for t
%
% This is a completely analytic solution. No calculations needed...
